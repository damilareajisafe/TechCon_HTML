            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began as a modest gathering of technology enthusiasts in the early 2000s, born out of a desire to connect passionate minds shaping the future of innovation. What started as a local meetup in Chicago has since evolved into a premier global conference attracting developers, engineers, tech entrepreneurs, and visionaries from around the world.

            <p>
                In its earliest years, TechCon focused on open-source software and grassroots innovation. Keynote sessions were informal, and the event provided a rare platform for developers to showcase side projects, exchange code, and discuss emerging tools. It was during this period that TechCon established its reputation for being “by builders, for builders.”

            <p>
                As the tech industry grew, so did TechCon. By the 2010s, it had become a launchpad for startups and a hotspot for major product announcements. Tracks expanded to include AI, blockchain, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and inclusive tech. TechCon also began incorporating hands-on workshops, hackathons, and community-driven panels.

            <p>
                The Chicago edition, in particular, emerged as the flagship event. Set against the city’s dynamic skyline, it drew tens of thousands of attendees annually and featured high-profile speakers from global tech giants and emerging disruptors alike. It also served as a hub for local innovation, giving Midwestern startups visibility on a global stage.
